Fish Species Identification System
This project utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to identify fish species from images or video feeds. The system leverages the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework and a TensorFlow-based classification model to perform fish species detection and classification.

Features
YOLOv8 Integration: Efficient object detection for identifying fish in input images.
Deep Learning Classification: Utilizes TensorFlow's pretrained models for precise fish species identification.
Real-time Notifications: Sends updates through Twilio for instant feedback on detections.
Computer Vision: Employs OpenCV for image preprocessing and visualization.
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Required libraries: torch, ultralytics, tensorflow, opencv-python, numpy, twilio.
Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Ensure the YOLO model and classification model are saved in the specified paths.
Run the script to detect fish species in input images or video feeds.
Configure Twilio credentials for notification functionality.
